# Snippets Library

Documenting common patterns used in browser extensions.

CSS class snippets are located in the `css` directory. JS snippets are divided into `js/chrome` and `js/firefox` snippets.

When adding new snippets, please make sure to:

 - provide meaningful filenames
 - write a description of what the snippet does
 - provide a URL with further documentation for the API/method
